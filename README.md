##Data Sources

Census Blocks TIGER/Shaperfile obtained from [US Census] (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/2010/geo/tiger-line-file.html).
Since the latest changes in boundaries of Census Blocks were made in 2010, I didn't have to worry about inconsistensies. 

Housing Units Estimates obtained from [US Census] (https://data.census.gov/map?g=050XX00US26163$1400000&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P1&layer=VT_2020_140_00_PY_D1&mode=thematic&loc=42.3350,-82.9896,z10.4068). I used only total housing units, but these sets
have plenty of data that might be interesting in examining the dynamics of abandonment too.

The Neighborhoods' boundaries obtained from [The City of Detroit Open Data Portal] (https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/neighborhoods/explore). There are many neighborhoods' boundaries, 
the overview of them you can see on the [Data Driven Detroit Portal] (https://datadrivendetroit.org/neighborhood-portal/). 



I am using Stadia.AlidadeSmooth as a basemap obtained from [Leaflet-providers] (https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/)
